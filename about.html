<!--Wrote a small about on this page, and some of the places ive seen in mexico just by coincidence 
also added cards of places i've seen in Mexico just by passing but never truly explored-->
            <h4 class="heading4">My first visits to Mexico</h4>
            <p class="story">My name is Anayeli Gonzalez and I am Mexican-American. I grew up in the United States and growing up I did not visit Mexico often since my parents
                saved money and didn't have enough for us (a total of 6) to go. I have gone to Mexico 3 times, once when I was a baby, when I was around 7 years old, and when I was 18 years old.
                I have only gone to visit family so we have always stayed in the area and have never gone to new areas to visit. In Nov. 2019, I had the opportunity to 
                go to Mexico for my uncle's wedding. I decided to go since my cousin and brother were going and my uncle lives near the metro stop Los Reyes which leads into the city. My cousin had visited Mexico City on a solo trip prior to the wedding. 
                She was my guide in the city and showed me different places that I have never seen before despite the trips I've made before with my family. This was the first time I got to explore the 
                city. I have started to make a list of places I've visted on my 2019 trip, and adding more places to visit since I will be going again in fall 2023 for Dia De Los Muertos.
